# SpaceX Launch Energy Calculator

## Goal
- Assess frontend  **React + TypeScript + GraphQL** skills based on **style, decisions, and approach**.

### Minimum Requirements
1. Query API and retrieve items.  
2. Show list of items.  
3. Allow selecting items.  
4. Show aggregated information (energy).

## Process
- Spend approximately **½ day**.  
- Choose areas to **focus**, don’t try to finish everything.  
- Submit **before the technical interview** (Git repo or zip).  
- Topics to discuss may include:  
  - Library choices and decisions  
  - Likes/dislikes of solution  
  - Difficulties and new technologies encountered  
  - Code clarity and maintainability  
  - Next improvements

## Assignment
- Build a **small React + TypeScript app** using the **SpaceX API** (or similar).  
- Display **launch information**.  
- Allow the **user to select multiple launches**.  
- Allow the user to **request the estimated total energy consumed** by the selected launches.  
- Display the **result**.

## Energy Calculation
- Energy = (rocket mass + fuel mass)  
- Fuel needed: **15 kg per 1 kg mass to LEO**  
- Fuel energy value: **1.35 × 10⁷ J/kg**


## Bonus / Nice-to-Haves
- Use a **user object** (mocked) to filter items based on permissions.  
- Add **data visualization** comparing multiple launches.  
- Customize at least **one UI library component**.  
- Any UI library is allowed (Material UI, Ant Design, etc.) or none.  
- Any API client is allowed (Apollo Client, graphql-request, Relay, etc.).
